Many people sometimes need to check change on web pages, such as when they wait for publishing some information or document.
I wanted to help  them and save their time  needed for manual checking some pages repeatedly.
I developed a desktop application, that can do this automatically.
The name of this application is Web Updating  Indicator.

I used the Qt library in c++ language which implements network connection, computing engine and graphic user interference.
I developed this app in Qt Creator, which is large Qt IDE with most functions such as code completing and hinting for c++ and Qt functions.
Git was used for version control of all project.
Everything (code and binary files) was publish thought them to Gitlab.
This app come under GNU LGPL licence.

I succeeded to deploy the application.
It is running on most of using Linux distribution and Windows as well.
A few people are using and testing this now.
It can check complex web pages with smart tools for comparing pages and log in to web app by cookie session. Different pages are shown in main window of this application.
User can view changes between two versions of page by graphic tools which open the page with colour marked changes.
It is possible to display all detected version of page by SQL query to database directly from the app whit graphic output.
